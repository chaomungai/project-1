# AI Module for Quality Control

## üìå Overview

This project is an AI-powered module developed to assist in **Quality Control (QC)** processes. It is designed to **study, analyze, and improve product quality assessment** using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to automate the detection of defects, irregularities, or inconsistencies in products during or after manufacturing.

## üîç Objectives

- Build a scalable AI module for real-time or batch quality control.
- Study how AI can be used to reduce human error in QC.
- Analyze and visualize QC data to gain insights.
- Experiment with different models and techniques (e.g., image processing, anomaly detection, etc.).

## üß† Key Features

- **Defect Detection:** Automatically identifies potential defects in products (e.g., scratches, cracks, misalignments).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses statistical and ML techniques to detect outliers or inconsistencies in data.
- **Data Visualization:** Dashboards and reports to understand QC trends and issues.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares different models for accuracy, precision, and recall.
